            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a larger skillet; cook stir onion and garlic until tender, about 5 minutes.

Allow mixture to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Unroll pizza dough on preheated pizza stone or a large baking sheet and brush with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Spread spinach mixture over dough, leaving a small border at the edge of the pizza crust. Top with 1 cup mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Press tomato slices into seasoned bread crumbs until coated; arrange tomatoes over pizza. Spread remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese and feta cheese over tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until pizza crust is golden brown and cheese is melted, about 15 minutes.</li>
